# Analog Mono VCA Compressor with Arduino Control

## Overview
This project is a analog audio compressor. It features a fully analog signal path using high-quality Op-Amps and an Arduino Uno for monitoring compression.

### Key Features
* **Analog Signal Path:** Utilizing TL072 Op-Amps for low noise and distortion.
* **Voltage Controlled Amplifier (VCA):** Precision gain reduction circuitry.
* **Peak Detection:** Integrated peak detector circuit for accurate signal tracking.
* **Arduino Integration:** Handles the UI, LED metering.
* **Dual Power Supply:** Integrated power management for +/- 12V rails.

## Technical Specifications
* **Input Stage:** Adjustable gain multiplier (up to x3).
* **Output Stage:** Adjustable gain multiplier (up to x3).
* ** x1 Input - x1 Output Design.
* **Control Voltage (CV):** Precision CV processing with positive converters and signal subtractors.
* **Visual Feedback:** 12-segment LED bar graph for gain reduction or level monitoring.
